# My Budget Docs ![MyBudget Docs version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/nicolasomar/my-budget-docs?color=success&label=%20&style=flat-square)
Web page based on Angular for documentation storage related to MyBudget App.

## What do I need?
Before cloning this repo, I recommend installing the following software:
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) >=12.16.1 to install packages
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) to run Angular specific commands

## Setup
After cloning the repo, go to the created folder and install the node packages (including [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/) at the global level).
```sh
git clone https://github.com/NicolasOmar/my-budget-docs.git
cd my-budget-docs
npm run setup
```

## How to run it
To run the app as a non-stopping service and start it in a new browser tab
```sh
npm start
```
To run the service only
```sh
npm run local
```

## Branches and Environments
Because I am using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to deploy and host the site, I am maintaining the `master` branch only.
Therefore, the following [link](https://nicolasomar.github.io/my-budget-docs) sends you to the last pushed and deployed version.
